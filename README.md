# DiscordIPBot
Get your IP address from a self-hosted Discord bot

# Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AlexIsOK/DiscordIPBot` and cd `cd DiscordIPBot`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the bot to generate an auth file: `node index.js`
4. Edit the file to include your token (and custom prefix, default is a comma)
5. Run the bot again: `node index.js`

You can also pass the token as a command line argument: `node index.js TOKEN`.
The command line token will be used instead of the stored one when possible.
