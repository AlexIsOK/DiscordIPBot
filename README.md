Get your IP address from a self-hosted Discord bot

# Installing

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AlexIsOK/DiscordIPBot` and cd `cd DiscordIPBot`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the bot to generate a config file: `node index.js`
4. Edit `config.json` to include your token (optionally custom prefix and command as well)
5. Run the bot again: `node index.js`

You can also pass the token as a command line argument: `node index.js -t TOKEN`.
The command line token will be used instead of the stored one when possible.
