# DiscordIPBot
Get your IP address from a self-hosted Discord bot

# Usage

First, install the dependencies: `npm install`\
Run the bot to generate an auth file: `node index.js`\
Edit the file to include your token (and custom prefix, default is a comma)\
Run the bot again: `node index.js`

You can also pass the token as a command line argument: `node index.js TOKEN`.
The command line token will be used instead of the stored one when possible.
